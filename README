Tools for generating lists of private elements (classes and packages) in the
Hadoop codebase.

Private means @Private, @LimitedPrivate or @Unstable.

Compile using:

  mvn compile

Then generate a list of private classes and packages using (adjust for
appropriate Common and MapReduce checkouts):

  ./list-private-elements.sh ~/workspace/hadoop-common-trunk/src/java/ ~/workspace/hadoop-mapreduce-trunk/src/java/ \
    | sort > private-elements
